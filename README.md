This is a repo for a beginner Rock, Paper, Scissors game! 

I'm following The Odin Project's curriculum, so there's nothing much to see here.

Update: 
Finally finished adding UI to the game! 
index2.html contains the game with added HTML and CSS functionality, while index.html contains a game that runs purely on the console.
